# Avigilon_ACM_API
Repo made public so others have access to the Avigilon ACM API to make developing code to manage the door controllers and users easier.
Their API accepts XML and JSON

I built this so I could use it in Okta Workflows to manage user lifecycles and probably more in the future. This allows us to get off the on-prem agent and just manage this whole app directly through the API/Workflows.

Identities file is a basic example of the fields used and how that looks in JSON. To get the full API you will need to request that from your ACM rep or reach out to their support. Right now they just provide it in a PDF file and it is written in RUBY...
